cpptasks for Apache Ant

  The cc task can compile various source languages and produce executables,
  shared libraries (aka DLL's) and static libraries. Compiler adaptors are currently available
  for C/C++, FORTRAN, MIDL and Windows Resource compilers.

  The task can be used with Apache Ant 1.5 and later.  This software is not a product
  of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) and no endorsement by the ASF is implied.


  To use:
     * Place cpptasks.jar into Ant's classpath by placing in Ant's lib directory,
          adding to CLASSPATH environment variable or using the -lib command line option.

     * Add type and task definitions in build file using either taskdef or antlib.

     * Add {{{antdocs/CCTask.html}cc}} element to some target in your build file.

     * Set path and environment variables to be able to run compiler from command line.

     * Build project.

   Trivial Sample using taskdef (compatible with Ant 1.5 or later):
   
+--
<project name="hello" default="compile">
    <taskdef resource="cpptasks.tasks"/>
    <target name="compile">
        <mkdir dir="target/main/obj"/>
        <cc outtype="executable" subsystem="console" outfile="target/hello" objdir="target/main/obj">
           <fileset dir="src/main/c" includes="*.c"/>
        </cc>
    </target>
</project>
+--

   Trivial Sample using antlib (compatible with Ant 1.6 or later):
   
+--
<project name="hello" default="compile" xmlns:cpptasks="antlib:net.sf.antcontrib.cpptasks">
    <target name="compile">
        <mkdir dir="target/main/obj"/>
        <cpptasks:cc outtype="executable" subsystem="console" outfile="target/hello" objdir="target/main/obj">
           <fileset dir="src/main/c" includes="*.c"/>
        </cpptasks:cc>
    </target>
</project>
+--
