<td>Set the 'if' condition.
 
 The processor will be ignored unless the property is defined.
 
 The value of property is insignificant, but values that would imply
 misinterpretation ("false", "no") will throw an exception when
 isActive() is evaluated.</td>

<tr>
<td>prototype</td>
<td>Sets file to precompile.
 
 Should be a source file that includes only one unguarded header file.
 Default value is "stdafx.cpp".</td>
<td>File</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>refid</td>
<td>Specifies that this element should behave as if the content of the
 element with the matching id attribute was inserted at this location.</td>
<td>Reference</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>unless</td>
<td>Set the 'unless' condition. If named property exists at execution time,
 the processor will be ignored.
 
 Value of property is insignificant, but values that would imply
 misinterpretation ("false", "no") of the behavior will throw an
 exception when isActive is called.</td>
